---------------

JOIN clauses

INNER JOIN - JOIN tables without any specifics - default

Primary key from main table = foreign key from another table

example:
So far we have only done:
SELECT <this>
FROM <table>

If <this> is a country code we will just see the code and not the country name

If we have another table that has the country and country code we can join that table to this main one to get the countryname based on country code

SELECT *
FROM dbo.Country
from dbo.geo_Desert

If we have many-to-many relationship we wil need to create a JOIN table

Table 1 PK  \
---------------- JOIN table with both tables PK
Table 2 PK  /
