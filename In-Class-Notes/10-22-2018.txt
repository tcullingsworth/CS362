SELECT FROM
WHERE
GROUP BY
HAVING
ORDER BY

----

GROUP BY - aggregate data
ORDER BY - sort results
HAVING - like the WHERE clause - filters results

----------

SELECT Province
	,SUM(ISNULL([Population],0)) as total_population
	,AVG(ISNULL([Population],0)) as average_population
FROM dbo.City
GROUP BY Province

By putitng ISNULL in parenthesis it will set the Population to 0 for any city that has NULL for population

-------------------

COUNT does not count NULL values

an aggregate can not appear in a WHERE clause
Need to use HAVING

in class demo

mortality rate = (# of deaths / population size) * 1000
